# KeyKit WebAssembly

This is a WebAssembly port of **KeyKit**, enabling KeyKit to run directly in web browsers using Emscripten and modern web APIs.
This repo is a stripped-down version of the https://github.com/nosuchtim/keykit repo, with only the WASM port and updates needed for that environment.

KeyKit is a programming language and graphical toolkit for realtime and algorithmic MIDI manipulation and experimentation.  It was created by Tim Thompson at AT&T Bell Labs and released in 1996.
Key capabilities include:

- **Algorithmic Composition** - Generate music programmatically
- **MIDI Processing** - Real-time manipulation of MIDI streams
- **Phrase Operations** - A MIDI phrase is a fundamental data type in the language
- **GUI** - A custom window system implemented completely in KeyKit code.
- **Interactive Tools** - Visual editors, piano roll, drum grid, and more
- **Extensibility** - Write custom tools and functions in the KeyKit language

## Features of this WASM port

- **Full KeyKit Language** - Complete implementation of the KeyKit programming language
- **HTML5 Canvas Graphics** - Interactive graphics with drawing primitives, colors, and bitmap operations
- **Web MIDI API** - Real-time MIDI input/output with browser-connected devices
- **Virtual Filesystem** - Runtime loading of 390+ library files
- **Synced Local Directory** - Files can be written to the local directory, which is synced with the virtual filesystem.

## Building and Running

Install [Emscripten SDK](https://emscripten.org/docs/getting_started/downloads.html) and Python 3.x, then

```bash
python create_dist.py dist/keykitcanvas
# in order to create dist/keykitcanvas.zip, then
cd dist
unzip keykitcanvas.zip
python keykitcanvas/serve.py
# In a WebMIDI-enabled browser, go to 127.0.0.1:8000/keykitcanvas/keykit.html

```

By default, it assumes the <a href="https://springbeats.com/sbvmidi">Springbeats Virtual MIDI Cable driver</a> is installed; MIDI output is connected to "Springbeats vMIDI1" and MIDI input is connected to "Springbeats vMIDI2".
Use the "Change Local Folder" button to attach the local directory you want to use.

## Architecture

KeyKit uses a **machine-dependent abstraction layer** to isolate platform-specific code. The WebAssembly port implements ~60 `mdep_*` functions in `src/mdep_wasm.c` that interface with JavaScript via Emscripten's `EM_ASM` macros.
The port uses two integration methods:

1. **EM_ASM** - Inline JavaScript in C for simple operations
2. **JavaScript Library** - `keykit_library.js` for complex features (Canvas, MIDI)

## MIDI Setup

KeyKit works with any Web MIDI compatible device.
For virtual MIDI routing on Windows,
use <a href="https://springbeats.com/sbvmidi">Springbeats Virtual MIDI Cable driver</a>.
Some of the files (e.g. libcore/keyrc.k) are hard-coded to open "Springbeats vMIDI1" for output and "Springbeats vMIDI2" for input.

The browser will prompt for MIDI access when the application starts. Grant permission to enable MIDI input/output.

## Regenerating Library Manifest

When adding/removing library files:

```bash
cd libcore
python generate_manifest.py
```

## Sample MIDI Files

The `music` directory includes sample MIDI files for testing:

- Bach Two-Part Inventions (`bachinv1.mid` - `bachinv8.mid`)

## Issues

- Sweeping operations are ugly due to the lack of real XOR graphics.
- If the keykit GUI doesn't show up (e.g. when you resize the browser), refresh the browser page.
- See the browser's Console for error messages.
